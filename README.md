Taught https://www.papareact.com/ community how to clone their website into a mobile app using react-native and expo

To start

1. Run yarn or npm install to install all neccessary dependancies
2. Run expo start to launch the bundler (you need to have installed expo-cli to do this!)
3. Launch the app on Web, iOS or Android using the expo CLI or interface! (Check Expo docs for more information)

Enjoy the build!
